# AI-Powered Merchant Compliance Checker

## Overview
Merchant website compliance checks are often time-consuming and require manual effort. This project aims to streamline the process by leveraging AI to scrape merchant websites, validate their legitimacy, and ensure they comply with product restrictions. 

## Problem Statement
Compliance officers spend a significant amount of time manually verifying merchant websites during onboarding. This project provides AI assistance to automate and enhance this process.

## Solution
- **Web Scraping:** Extract relevant information from merchant websites.
- **AI-Powered Analysis:** Validate legitimacy, verify product offerings, and detect restricted products.
- **Scoring System:** Compare automated results with human evaluations.
- **Actionable Recommendations:** Assist compliance officers with decision-making.

## Features (MVP Scope)
- Scrape websites for legitimacy signals.
- Verify ownership of a website against a specified merchant.
- Confirm that products are being sold.
- Detect restricted products (requiring human verification for final approval).

## Technical Challenges
- Ensuring AI successfully extracts relevant compliance-related information.
- Generating a confidence score for compliance checks.

## Stretch Goals
- Provide a verification score to compare with human evaluations.
- Recommend third-party internal verification for enhanced accuracy.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React
- **Backend:** Node.js / Express
- **Web Scraping:** Puppeteer
- **AI Models:** OpenAI API
- **Database:** PostgreSQL / MongoDB / ImgBB / Pinecone
- **Hosting & Deployment:** Vercel
